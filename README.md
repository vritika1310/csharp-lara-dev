You must to have a github account to add yourself in list. 

To add a personal

- [x] -> login in your account 
- [x] -> edit `personals.json` file 
- [x] -> add a block like this given below

Here is an Example:
```
{
    "name": "Your Name",
    "email": "xxxx@zzzz.com",
    "phone": "Your Phone",
    "role": "(Web Developer/Software Engineer)",
    "city": "Dhaka, Bangladesh",
    "company": "(Compnay Name)", // not more than 22 character
    "working_in": "JavaScript, Node.js, Laravel", // your working areas
    "github": "username",
    "facebook": "username"

>For Github and Facebook just add your `username` not full url. Make sure your details object inside the `]` second bracket and add coma `,` in last object end.
